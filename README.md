# Image-Watermarking
Watermarking letters into image using maximum length sequence with C++.<br>
It is based watermarked image g(x,y) = f(x,y) + a(x,y) * m(x,y)<br>
where, f(x,y) is original, a(x,y) is defined by HVS, m(x,y) is message.<br>

## Encoding
1. Devide image into 64 * 64 blocks and strech each block into 1 * 4096 array.<br>
2. first 1024 will be synchronization part, and remaining 3072 will be message part.<br>
